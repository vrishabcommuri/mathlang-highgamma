TODO:

cocktail predictors need to be foreground and background separately

check that the range over which we are boosting is correct for mathlang (is -41
to 210 correct, or should it be 0 to 300ish as the mathlang paper suggests)

1/26/2022: the above two are done.

Now, we need to
- produce TRFs using the noise model
- produce cocktail TRFs using the middle part of the stimulus/signals (to ensure 
  that the foreground and background being briefly separated does not change
  things).


break up into best performing half and worst performing half (use t test)

mixed effects linear model -- allow you to have different amounts of variability
per subject

askd joshua for lit review
check google scholar
Look at Gavin Bidelman -- he does a lot for eeg responses in this same freq range 
 has been arguing for cortical and subcortical differences
Emily Coffee(?) paper 2019 on FFR Nina Kraus is a coauthor. Have references to when this is done in noise.

Ask Joshua for his opinion on venues

Look in R: all permutations of mixed linear models (don't know if there is a correction applied) 
 - buildmer

take "or" of all significant portions in the TFCE test

----------------------
Preliminary results

significant difference between speaker TRFs in the singlespeaker case (as expected)



TODO:

Need to run the james and kate cp math trf code

Also need permuted predictors for all cp conditions

Produce significant regions on all TRFs
- can do now for ss conditions

Need to run the following mixed effects tests:
ss (does the speaker matter -- male vs female, should be significant):
- james math vs kate math 5.99991e-05
- james lang vs kate lang 5.99991e-05
cp (does attention matter -- foreground vs background, could either be significant or not):
- james math (fg) kate lang (bg) vs kate lang (fg) james math (bg) attended
- james math (fg) kate lang (bg) vs kate lang (fg) james math (bg) unattended
- james lang (fg) kate math (bg) vs kate math (fg) james lang (bg) attended
- james lang (fg) kate math (bg) vs kate math (fg) james lang (bg) unattended

two p-values for each experiment, so apply two Bonferroni corrections.



Maybe redo mixed effects:
power ~ 1+att+sex+type+(1|subj)
power ~ 1+att+sex+type+att*sex+ ...

need abstract by 26

next steps

reanalyze the power 
mixed effects model using average power as well just to see difference

which plots should go into paper and poster

tell that story using figures 

~5 total figs 

give an organizerd presentation end of march

look at stimuli for next experiment

Tuesday at 2
